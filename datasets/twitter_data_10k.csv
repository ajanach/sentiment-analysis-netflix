I am sorry Vedika was ABSOLUTE  DISASTER.  Story of this show is so good but casting was horrible. This show could have been made so well but HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. If you planned to do this show in UK, then hire local British born Indian actors. Jimmy Shergill is excellent actor so you need casting with same caliber and who can face him with talent. I know it‚Äôs fiction but many things were overlooked specially when it‚Äôs crime drama.  Face recognition is normal tool, Psyche evaluations are so Normal in force and how did the killer pass the test. Hum jaise log jo cybersecurity mai kaam karte hai, itna zabaradast tests pass karna padta hai every year.  Kuch bhi nahi dikha sakte. Audience is very smart now. 

You needed a strong talented actress as a lead.

My hopes for this show were not high. I thought it would be another mindless, overpowered, knows-everything girl-boss emasculating Arnold at every turn, while defeating male opponents twice her size. 

I‚Äôm only six episodes in and I am pleasantly surprised to say that it‚Äôs not that at all. The woke is kept to a bare minimum. Arnold plays a flawed but caring father trying to restore his family. And despite the daughter being good at everything, she‚Äôs still called out for her shortcomings and put in her place a number of times, while also learning and growing into a better character.

Everyone else is awesome in their roles. Fortune Feimster‚Äôs character Roo is hilarious. And despite being a lesbian, it‚Äôs not made the center point for her character at all, which, in 2023, is refreshing to see.

The only character that is somewhat aggravating is the meek and whiney Jay Baruchel playing Carter, the daughter‚Äôs love interest. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Baruchel is funny in some things, like ‚ÄúKnocked Up,‚Äù but it just feels wrong if she ends up with him in this series. I hope she leaves him for Aldon.

And the glorification propaganda of government alphabet agencies aside (who, in reality, also constantly spy on and psyop Americans on a daily basis), this is actually a really good and fun show to watch."

Bheed is not a movie. It's a reminder of the dark phase that India went through during the pandemic. 

It is a refreshment of your memories. 

@anubhavsinha brings to us the sordid tale of a terrifying ordeal that the migrant workers had to go through. 

From the very first scene, your blood curdles and you know it is not going to be an easy ride for the viewers as it brings back the memories of when the news flashed on your screens which proclaimed migrant workers being cut into pieces by a train as they trudged their way down the tracks towards their home. 

Bheed reminds you of the society that we live in. 

Of the disparity between income groups, of the discrimination amongst classes. 

Of people blinded by hate against religions. 

Of powerful egos that levy the laws and the weak resilience that struggles to find a path to survive. 

Of the privileged malls that are protected as the poor are denied the basic necessities. 

The characters are all real.....

#PankajKapur the man who is fighting to feed his family and yet couldn't get his caste supremacy out of the way.....

@bhumipednekar,  the frontline health worker, who wants to help people but is herself unsure how.....

@ranaashutosh10 the Cop who follows orders, is a part of the system, till the system shows him his true place....

@deespeak the privileged society, who has their own problems to deal with and wouldn't mind running over the poor to achieve that......

And YOU... You are a part of the Bheed too, for you will remember what it was that you were doing when all this was happening. 

All the characters were real, they remind you of people that exist, that you read about, that you saw on the news, that you, perhaps were a part of...

The only fictitious character was @RajkummarRao, the Hero who wants equality, the Hero who wants justice...

A Hero that never was, an equality that doesn't exist and a justice that is always evasive...

Despite the heavy cuts by the CBFC, Anubhav Sinha pulls no punches as he reminds you of the society that you live in and shows you the mirror unapologetically of what part of that society you are...

Bheed ends without a message... But the messages reaches you well. That is if you introspect, if you want to introspect...

DRSRating: None

Disclaimer: I am not going to rate Bheed, I don't think, I can. Because as I said before, Bheed is not a movie, it's a refreshment of your memories. I really can't rate these memories, as yours will be different from mine..."
