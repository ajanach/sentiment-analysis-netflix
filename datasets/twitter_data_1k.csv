I am sorry Vedika was ABSOLUTE  DISASTER.  Story of this show is so good but casting was horrible. This show could have been made so well but HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. If you planned to do this show in UK, then hire local British born Indian actors. Jimmy Shergill is excellent actor so you need casting with same caliber and who can face him with talent. I know it‚Äôs fiction but many things were overlooked specially when it‚Äôs crime drama.  Face recognition is normal tool, Psyche evaluations are so Normal in force and how did the killer pass the test. Hum jaise log jo cybersecurity mai kaam karte hai, itna zabaradast tests pass karna padta hai every year.  Kuch bhi nahi dikha sakte. Audience is very smart now. 

You needed a strong talented actress as a lead.
